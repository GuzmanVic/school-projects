                And all the things you do
                Yeah, they were all yellow
                
                I came along, I wrote a song for you
                And everything you do
                And it was called yellow
                
                So then I took my turn
                Oh, what a thing to 've done
                And it was all yellow

                Oh, what a thing to do
                'Coz you were all yellow
                
                I drew a line, I drew a line for you
                Oh, what a thing to do, my love
                And it was all yellow
                Yeah, yeah, yeah
